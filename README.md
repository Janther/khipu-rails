# KhipuRails

[Khipu](https://khipu.com/home) is a service that facilitates web billing and collection in **Chile**.

It handles very elegantly bank transfers and allows to generate bills in batches.
It offers an API for developers to create via POST new charges.

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile and run the `bundle` command to install it.
```ruby
gem 'khipu-rails'
```

If you want to work with the gem in development, you can allways use the git repository.
```ruby
gem 'khipu-rails', :git => "http://github.com/Janther/khipu-rails"
```

## Configuration v0.0.2
Version 0.0.2 will have a configure method much more flexible and powerfull
```ruby
KhipuRails.configure do |config|
  ##
  # Use receivers to set one or more receivers to the gem.
  # #add_receiver has 3 parameters, receiver_id, receiver_key, and receiver_mode(:dev|:pro) 
  ##
  config.add_receiver "receiver1_id", "receiver1_key", :dev
  config.add_receiver "receiver2_id", "receiver2_key", :pro
                      ...

  ##
  # Use button_images to set one or more urls for the custom button images you might have.
  # Khipu's images are already registered.
  # Each button image is key/value pair
  # The same as with the receivers registration, use this method as a shortcut for long urls on your view.
  ##
  config.button_images.merge! :shortcut => "url"

  ##
  # The hash defaults can also be modified, giving you control of the default values the helper khipu_button uses.
  ##
  config.button_defaults.merge! :variable_name => variable_value
end
```
